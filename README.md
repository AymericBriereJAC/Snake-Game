# Snake-Game

## What is This C# console Project?

This was my final project for programming 1.
The goal was to make a c# console game that demonstrated the concepts we learned in class.
We only were allowed to use functional programming ence no class being used

### What where the concepts we learned in class?

The concepts we learned in class were variables and their scopes, function (including parameters
and return values), pass-by-reference, single dimension arrays, and debugging. We did not learn 
objects when I did this game that is why I did not use them

### How to Run the Project?

Simply download the repository, and run with with visual studio code
