# Snake-Game

## What is This C# console Project?

This was my final project for programming 1.
The goal was to make a c# console game that demonstrated the concepts we learned in class.

### What where the concepts we learned in class?

The concepts we learned in class where variables and their scopes, function (including parameters
and return values), pass by reference, single dimension arrays and debbuging. We did not learned 
objects when i did this game thats why i did not use them
